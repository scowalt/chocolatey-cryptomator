    <summary>Multi-platform transparent client-side encryption of your files in the cloud.</summary>
    <description>## Features

- Works with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Nextcloud and any other cloud storage service which synchronizes with a local directory
- Open Source means: No backdoors, control is better than trust
- Client-side: No accounts, no data shared with any online service
- Totally transparent: Just work on the virtual drive as if it were a USB flash drive
- AES encryption with 256-bit key length
- File names get encrypted
- Folder structure gets obfuscated
- Use as many vaults in your Dropbox as you want, each having individual passwords

### Privacy

- 256-bit keys (unlimited strength policy bundled with native binaries)
- Scrypt key derivation
- Cryptographically secure random numbers for salts, IVs and the masterkey of course
- Sensitive data is wiped from the heap asap
- Lightweight: [Complexity kills security](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html)

### Consistency

- HMAC over file contents to recognize changed ciphertext before decryption
- I/O operations are transactional and atomic, if the filesystems support it
- Each file contains all information needed for decryption (except for the key of course), no common metadata means no [SPOF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)

### Security Architecture

    <releaseNotes>#Improvements

 - Fixed system error 53/67 that rarely occurred on some Windows systems, because of a missing registry value
 - Saved password can now be forgotten by deselecting the checkbox
 - WebDAV server keeps running after unlocking a vault even if mounting fails
 - Log files don't contain debug-level information per default anymore, added debug mode in settings</releaseNotes>
